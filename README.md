vim-LanguageTool
----------------

This plugin integrates the LanguageTool grammar checker into Vim.
LanguageTool is an Open Source style and grammar checker for English,
French, German, etc. See http://www.languagetool.org/languages/ for a
complete list of supported languages.

LanguageTool detects grammar mistakes that a spelling checker cannot detect
such as "it work" instead of "it works". LanguageTool can also detect spelling
mistakes using Hunspell dictionaries bundled with LanguageTool for several
languages or using morfologik for other languages.
Vim builtin spelling checker can also of course be used along with
LanguageTool. One advantage of the spelling checker of LanguageTool over
Vim spelling checker, is that it uses the native Hunspell dictionary directly,
so it works even with the latest Hunspell dictionaries containing features
not supported by Vim. For example, the latest French Hunspell dictionaries
from http://www.dicollecte.org are not supported by Vim but they work well
with LanguageTool. On the other hand, the Vim native spelling checker is
faster and better integrated with Vim.

See http://www.languagetool.org/ for more information about LanguageTool.

# Usage

* Use `:LanguageToolCheck` to check grammar in the current buffer.
  This will check for grammar mistakes and highlight grammar or
  spelling mistakes. It also opens a new scratch window with the
  list of errors with further explanations about each error.
  Pressing <Enter> in an error in the scratch buffer will jump to
  that error in the text. The location list for the buffer being
  checked is also populated, so you can use location commands
  such as `:lopen` to open the location list window, `:lne` to
  jump to the next error, etc.
  The `:LanguageToolCheck` command accepts a range. You can for example check
  grammar between lines 100 and 200 in buffer with `:100,200LanguageToolCheck`,
  or check grammar in the visual selection with `:<',>'LanguageToolCheck`.
  The default range is 1,$ (whole buffer).

* Use `:LanguageToolClear` to remove highlighting of grammar
  mistakes, close the scratch window containing the list of errors,
  clear and close the location list.

* Use `:help LanguageTool` to get more details on various commands
  and configuration information.

The two commands are also available from the menu in gvim:
```
Plugin -> LanguageTool -> Check
                       -> Clear
```

# Installing the Vim plugin

## Installing vim-LanguageTool with a plugin manager

You can use any popular plugin manager according to your preference.
For example, with [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim),
add this line in your `.vimrc`:
```
Plugin 'dpelle/vim-LanguageTool'

```

## Installing vim-LanguageTool without a plugin manager

If you don't use a plugin manager, copy those files in your `$HOME/.vim/`
directory:
```
  .vim/plugin/LanguageTool.vim
  .vim/doc/LanguageToo.doc

```
And run `vim -c 'helptags ~/.vim/doc'`.

# Download LanguageTool

To use this plugin, you need to install the Java LanguageTool grammar
checker. You can chose to:

* Download the stand-alone version of
  LanguageTool(LanguageTool-\*.zip) from
  [here](https://dev.languagetool.org/http-server.html) using the 
  first link labeled "Getting the server" at the top of the page.

* or download a nightly build LanguageTool-.\*-snapshot.zip from
  http://www.languagetool.org/download/snapshots/. It contains a
  more recent version than the stable version but it is not tested
  as well. 

* or checkout and build the latest LanguageTool from sources in git
  from https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool

Recent versions of LanguageTool require Java-8.

## Download the stand-alone version of LanguageTool

Download the stand-alone version of LanguageTool (LanguageTool-*.zip)
from https://dev.languagetool.org/http-server.html, scroll down and click on
"Desktop version for offline use" to download it. Unzip it:
```
  $ unzip LanguageTool-4.9.zip
```
This should extract the file LanguageTool-4.9/languagetool-commandline.jar
among several other files.

## Build LanguageTool from sources in git

If you prefer to build LanguageTool yourself from sources, you first need
to install the prerequisite packages. On Ubuntu, you need to install the
following packages:
```
  $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk maven git
```
LanguageTool can then be downloaded and built with Maven as follows:
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool.git
  $ cd languagetool
  $ mvn clean package
```
After the build, the command line version of LanguageTool can be found in:
```
  ./languagetool-standalone/target/LanguageTool-5.0-SNAPSHOT/LanguageTool-5.0-SNAPSHOT/languagetool-commandline.jar
```
The version number in the path can vary.

# Configuration

LanguageTool plugin uses the character encoding from the 'fenc' option or from
the 'enc' option if 'fenc' is empty.

Several global variables can be set in your `.vimrc` to configure the behavior
of the LanguageTool plugin.

## `g:languagetool_jar`

This variable specifies the location of the LanguageTool java grammar
checker program. Default is empty.
Example:

```
:let g:languagetool_jar='$HOME/languagetool/languagetool-standalone/target/LanguageTool-5.0-SNAPSHOT/LanguageTool-5.0-SNAPSHOT/languagetool-commandline.jar'
```

## `g:languagetool_lang`

This variable specifies the language code to use for the language tool checker.
If undefined, plugin tries to guess the language of the Vim spelling checker
'spelllang' or v:lang. If neither work, plugin defaults to English US (en-US).
For languages with variants (currently English, German and Portuguese), it is
necessary to specify the variant in order for LanguageTool to signal spelling
errors. In other words, with  :set spelllang=en  LanguageTool only signals
grammar mistakes whereas with  :set spelllang=en_us LanguageTool signals
spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes. The valid language codes are:

```
ast    Asturian
be     Belarusian
br     Breton
ca     Catalan
cs     Czech
da     Danish
de     German
de-AT  German  (Austria)

```

## `g:languagetool_disable_rules`

This variable specifies checker rules which are disabled. Each disabled
rule must be comma separated.

Default value set by plugin is: WHITESPACE_RULE,EN_QUOTES

## `g:languagetool_enable_rules`

This variable specifies checker rules which are enabled.

## `g:languagetool_disable_categories`

This variable specifies checker rule-categories which are disabled.

## `g:languagetool_enable_categories`

This variable specifies checker rule-categories which are enabled.

## `g:languagetool_win_height`

This variable specifies the height of the scratch window which contains
all grammatical mistakes with some explanations. You can use a negative
value to disable opening the scratch window. You can also make it empty ''
to let Vim pick a default size.
Default is: 14

## Colors

You can customize the following syntax highlighting groups:
```
LanguageToolCmd
LanguageToolErrorCount
LanguageToolLabel
LanguageToolUrl
LanguageToolGrammarError
LanguageToolSpellingError
```
For example, to highlight grammar mistakes in blue, and spelling mistakes in
red, with a curly underline in vim GUIs that support it, add this into your
colorscheme:

```
hi LanguageToolGrammarError  guisp=blue gui=undercurl guifg=NONE guibg=NONE ctermfg=white ctermbg=blue term=underline cterm=none
hi LanguageToolSpellingError guisp=red  gui=undercurl guifg=NONE guibg=NONE ctermfg=white ctermbg=red  term=underline cterm=none
```
